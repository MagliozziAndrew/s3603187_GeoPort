		This website is the geoportfolio of Andrew Magliozzi which was made for the subject Professional Practice (GEOM2116). The website entails
		information that is academically and profesionally related to the field of geospatial science
		<p>
		A brief introduction about myself is that I am born and raised in Melbourne, Australia and as of June 1997, I am in my final year of the 
		Bachelor of Science (Geospatial Science) (Honours) course. My geospatial-related interests is working with remote sensing data, specifically creating 
		and analysing 3D models using point cloud data. My current geospatial project is analysing the change of fuel structure with vegetation age using a Mobile Laser Scanning.

		<p>
		My own personal hobbies include sports and playing table top games! More detailed information can be found in the About page!

	<div class="academic-intro">
		My capstone project is the analysis of fuel structure to identify changes of vegetation age. This research project was completed as a self-actuated course at RMIT, where the project was
		designed and implemented by myself and academic supervisors (Karin Reinke & Simon Jones). During the completion of the capstone project, major assessments were completed in order to satisfy
		the final requirements of the honours degree:
		<ul>
			<li>Literature Review: Designing a report for the project by outlining the purpose/rationale of the project and describing key literature relevant to the project.</li>
			<li>Poster Presentation: Conference presentation to collagues and industry professionals of the intial capstone design.</li>
			<li>Final Implementation: Final semester procedures to collect, examine, and present results.</li>
		</ul>

			<li>Vertical Profile of Vegetation</li>
			<li>Fractional Cover</li>

	<span class="title-ul">Industry Experience</span>
</div>
<div class="academic-intro">
	This page will briefly cover my work experience as a geospatial consultant within the industry. The company that I  worked for 
	during my studies was Aurecon Group. This page will outline the role and work completed during my tenure at the company.
</div>

<!--COMPANY 1-->

<div class="bar"><h3>Aurecon Group</h3></div> <!-- #ID# #COMPANY# Change to your company name-->
<img src="Aurecon.png" class="company-logo">
<div class="job-title">Geospatial Intern & Student Surveyor</div> <!-- #ID# #COMPANY# Change to your company position-->
<div class="job-time">Februrary 2022 - Current</div> <!--Change the month and year worked-->
<div class="job-overview">
	I began working at Aurecon Group at the beginning of my second year at university, where I worked as a student surveyor to obtain industry experience and skills. 
	My employment at the company is based within the Melbourne Office, where my engagement included working from home, the office, and on worksites where required.
	The following tasks were completed during my employment at Aurecon:
	<ul>
		<li>Applying surveying skills under the direction of an experienced Surveyor,</li>
		<li>Assist with field operations including setting up equipment and collecting data,</li>
		<li>Digitising and extracting data with geospatial programs (such as ArcGIS & MicroStation),</li>
		<li>Compiling notes to understand and complete tasks efficiently; and</li>
		<li>To seek knowledge and opportunities to enhance my skills within the role.</li>
	</ul>
	<p> My experience at Aurecon as a student Surveyor has been very fulfilling and educational. I have been able to improve my communication skills with co-workers onsite, 
		and what questions to ask my supervisor and how to ask them. Where university coordinators would provide answers, work experience at Aurecon has taught me how to
		 identify the answer to my question individually. I always have my work reviewed, but this concept has elevated my growth as a student. As a result, 
		 I have progressively looked to improving my knowledge at the company by writing down notes in OneNote and keeping documents onsite such as standard codes. 
		 The ability to connect with individuals within and outside of Aurecon has improved my professionalism and confidence within the industry and in life. 
		 Where working with students in university is minimal, its mandatory to be able to work in a team to optimise the success of a project. 
		 Where the scientific principles of university has enabled me to work in the role as a student Surveyor, the work experience over the last year at 
		 Aurecon has provided the professional insight required to flourish in the geospatial industry.</p>
